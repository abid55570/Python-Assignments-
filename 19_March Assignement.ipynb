    "In this case, the number of principal components to retain would depend on the variance explained by each component and the desired level of dimensionality reduction. Analyzing the cumulative explained variance ratio can help in making an informed decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the cumulative explained variance ratio indicates that the first two principal components explain around 90% of the total variance, you may choose to retain these two components. This would capture a substantial amount of the variance in the data while reducing the dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final decision on the number of principal components to retain depends on the specific requirements of your analysis and the trade-off between dimensionality reduction and the amount of information retained. It is recommended to experiment with different numbers of principal components and evaluate the performance of subsequent analysis tasks, such as modeling or classification, to determine the optimal number of components for your specific use case."
