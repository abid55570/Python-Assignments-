The monotonic relationship indicates that the direction of the relationship is consistent, although it may not be strictly linear.\n",

    "Comparing the two coefficients, we observe that the Pearson correlation coefficient is slightly smaller in magnitude than the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. This can be attributed to the fact that the Pearson correlation measures the linear relationship, while the Spearman's rank correlation measures the monotonic relationship without assuming linearity. In this case, since the relationship between hours of exercise and BMI is not strictly linear, the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient may provide a more appropriate measure of the relationship.\n",
