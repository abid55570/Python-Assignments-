    "The close() function in Python is used to close an opened file. It's important to close a file because it releases the resources used by the file object, such as the memory used to buffer the data and any system resources used to maintain the connection to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a file is not closed properly, it can cause problems such as memory leaks or resource starvation, which can impact the performance of the program and potentially cause it to crash. Additionally, if the file object is not closed before the program ends, any data that has not been written to the file may be lost.\n",
