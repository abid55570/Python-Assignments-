    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are both mathematical functions used in probability theory and statistics to describe the probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "The PMF is used for discrete random variables, which take on a countable number of possible values. It gives the probability that a random variable takes on a specific value. The PMF is defined as P(X = x), where X is the random variable and x is a specific value. The PMF satisfies two properties: it must be non-negative for all values, and the sum of the probabilities for all possible values must equal 1.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The random variable X represents the outcome of the roll. The PMF for this situation is:\n",
    "P(X = 1) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 2) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 3) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 4) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 5) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 6) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "The PDF is used for continuous random variables, which can take on any value within a range or interval. It gives the probability density of a random variable at a particular value. Unlike the PMF, the PDF does not give the probability of a specific value, but rather the relative likelihood of a value occurring. The area under the PDF curve over a specific interval represents the probability of the random variable falling within that interval.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a continuous random variable X that follows a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The PDF for this situation is given by the mathematical expression of the normal distribution. For any specific value of x, the PDF provides the height of the curve at that point, indicating the relative likelihood of that value occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that for continuous random variables, the probability of a single point is zero, as the area under the curve at a single point is infinitesimally small. Thus, the probability is defined for intervals rather than individual points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the PMF is used for discrete random variables and gives the probability of specific values, while the PDF is used for continuous random variables and gives the relative likelihood of values occurring by providing the probability density at each point."

For discrete random variables, the CDF is calculated by summing up the probabilities of all values less than or equal to the given value. For continuous random variables, the CDF is calculated by integrating the probability density function (PDF) over the range from negative infinity to the given value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let's consider a random variable X that follows a discrete distribution representing the number of heads obtained when flipping a fair coin twice. The possible values for X are 0, 1, and 2. The CDF for this random variable can be calculated as follows:\n",

    "The parameters of the normal distribution are the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). These parameters play a crucial role in determining the shape of the distribution:\n",

    "The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution that represents a random experiment with two possible outcomes: success or failure. It is named after the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli. The distribution is characterized by a single parameter, usually denoted as p, which represents the probability of success.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "One common example of the Bernoulli distribution is flipping a fair coin. We can define a random variable X, where X = 1 represents a \"heads\" outcome (success) and X = 0 represents a \"tails\" outcome (failure). In this case, the probability of success (getting a head) is 0.5, and the probability of failure (getting a tail) is also 0.5. Therefore, the Bernoulli distribution can be used to model the outcome of a single coin flip.\n",
