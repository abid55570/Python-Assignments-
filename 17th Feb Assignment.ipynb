    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional relational model based on tables, rows, and columns. Instead, they use flexible data models, such as document-based, key-value, or graph-based, to store and manage data. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, which can be difficult to manage using traditional SQL databases.\n",

    "MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility and scalability are important: MongoDB's document-based model allows for flexible and dynamic data structures, which makes it easier to adapt to changing data requirements and scale horizontally by adding more nodes to a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rapid development cycles: MongoDB's schema-less design allows for faster development cycles and more agile application development, as changes to the data model can be made on the fly without the need for schema migrations.\n",

    "In MongoDB, there are three different methods for deleting documents and collections:\n",

For example, you may want to delete a customer's record from a \"customers\" collection when the customer no longer uses your service. Or you may want to drop an entire collection when it is no longer needed.\n",
