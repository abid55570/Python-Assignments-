    "R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of a linear regression model. It quantifies the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables included in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is calculated as the ratio of the explained sum of squares (ESS) to the total sum of squares (TSS). Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared = ESS / TSS\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "ESS is the sum of squared differences between the predicted values and the mean of the dependent variable.\n",
    "TSS is the sum of squared differences between the actual values and the mean of the dependent variable.\n",
    "The R-squared value ranges between 0 and 1. A value of 0 indicates that the independent variables do not explain any of the variability in the dependent variable, while a value of 1 indicates that the independent variables perfectly explain the variability in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "The R-squared value provides an indication of the goodness-of-fit of the regression model. It represents the proportion of the total variation in the dependent variable that is accounted for by the independent variables. A higher R-squared value suggests that a larger proportion of the variability in the dependent variable is explained by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that R-squared alone does not indicate the validity or accuracy of the model. It does not account for the potential presence of omitted variables, multicollinearity, or other issues. Therefore, it is crucial to consider other evaluation metrics and diagnostic tests to assess the overall quality and reliability of the regression model."

    "Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of the R-squared statistic that takes into account the number of predictors in a linear regression model. It adjusts the R-squared value by penalizing the addition of unnecessary predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "While R-squared provides a measure of the proportion of variance explained by the predictors in the model, it can be misleading when additional predictors are added to the model, regardless of their actual relevance. R-squared tends to increase with the addition of more predictors, even if those predictors do not contribute significantly to explaining the variation in the dependent variable. This is known as overfitting.\n",

    "Adjusted R-squared addresses this issue by penalizing the addition of irrelevant predictors. It adjusts the R-squared value by considering the number of predictors and the sample size. It takes into account the degrees of freedom in the model and provides a more conservative estimate of the model's goodness-of-fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, adjusted R-squared is calculated using the following formula:\n",

This can be useful when the cost or impact of larger errors is significant in the context of the problem.\n",

    "Loss of interpretability: The penalty terms introduced in regularized linear models can make the resulting coefficients less interpretable.

Selecting the optimal hyperparameters can be challenging, and different datasets may require different tuning approaches. Improper tuning can result in underfitting or overfitting.\n",

In such cases, more flexible models like polynomial regression or non-linear regression techniques may be more appropriate.\n",
